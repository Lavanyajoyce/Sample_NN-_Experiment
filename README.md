# Experiment--Implementation-of-MLP-for-Breast-Cancer-Detection
## AIM:

To perform Data preprocessing in a data set downloaded from Kaggle

## EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:
Hardware – PCs
Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Google Colab /Jupiter Notebook

## Algorithm:
Step 1:Import the required libraries: numpy, pandas, MLPClassifier, train_test_split, StandardScaler, accuracy_score, and matplotlib.pyplot.
Step 2:Load the heart disease dataset from a file using pd.read_csv().
Step 3:Separate the features and labels from the dataset using data.iloc values for features (X) and data.iloc[:, -1].values for labels (y).
Step 4:Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
Step 5:Normalize the feature data using StandardScaler() to scale the features to have zero mean and unit variance.
Step 6:Create an MLPClassifier model with desired architecture and hyperparameters, such as hidden_layer_sizes, max_iter, and random_state.
Step 7:Train the MLP model on the training data using mlp.fit(X_train, y_train). The model adjusts its weights and biases iteratively to minimize the training loss.
Step 8:Make predictions on the testing set using mlp.predict(X_test).
Step 9:Evaluate the model's accuracy by comparing the predicted labels (y_pred) with the actual labels (y_test) using accuracy_score().
Step 10:Print the accuracy of the model.
Step 11:Plot the error convergence during traini#ng using plt.plot() and plt.show().
